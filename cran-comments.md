## CRAN check issues

* Fixed this warning: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/bcdata-00check.html
We are now precompiling vignettes so that functions are run locally and not on CRAN. This will ensure 
that any outages in the data source will not cause false positive for CRAN checks.
* Fixed this note: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-gcc/bcdata-00check.html
We are now explicitly importing `methods::setoldClass`
