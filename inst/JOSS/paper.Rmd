# Introduction

The British Columbia government hosts over 2000 tabular and spatial data sets in the B.C. Data Catalogue (BCDC; @bcdc).  Most provincial spatial data is available through the B.C. Data Catalogue under an open licence, via a [Web Feature Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service) (WFS). WFS is a powerful and flexible service for distributing geographic features over the web, that supports both spatial and non-spatial querying.  The bcdata package for the R programming language (@RCore) wraps two distinct but complimentary web APIs - one for the BCDC, and one for the WFS.  This allows R users to search, download, and import data from the BCDC, as well as efficiently query and directly read spatial data from the WFS into their R session. The bcdata package implements a novel application of dbplyr (@dbplyr) using a WFS backend, rather than a database backend, where a locally constructed query is processed by a remote server. This allows for fast and efficient spatial data retrieval using familiar dplyr syntax. Through this functionality the bcdata package connects British Columbia open data holdings with the vast capabilities of R.

# Usage 

bcdata connects to the B.C. Data Catalogue and the Web Feature Service through a few key functions:

- `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in the default browser
- `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
- `bcdc_search_facets()` - List catalogue facet search options
- `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
- `bcdc_tidy_resources()` - Get a data frame of resources for a record
- `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
- `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data available through a [Web Feature Service](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E)

### `bcdc_get_data()`

Once the user has located the B.C. Data Catalogue record with the data they want, `bcdata::bcdc_get_data()` can be used to download and read the data from the record.  Any of the record name, permanent ID or the result from `bcdc_get_record()` can be used to specify the resource. `bcdc_get_data` will automatically detect the type of data being requested and return the appropriate type. Let's try to access data for scholarships in B.C. schools:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bc_scholarships <- bcdc_get_data('bc-schools-district-provincial-scholarships')
```

```
The record you are trying to access appears to have more than one resource.
 Resources: 
1) AwardsScholarshipsHist.xlsx
     format: xlsx 
     url: http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/reporting/odefiles/AwardsScholarshipsHist.xlsx 
     resource: 4e872f59-0127-4c21-9f41-52d87af9cfab 
     code: bcdc_get_data(record = '651b60c2-6786-488b-aa96-c4897531a884', resource = '4e872f59-0127-4c21-9f41-52d87af9cfab')

2) AwardsScholarshipsHist.txt
     format: txt 
     url: http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/reporting/odefiles/AwardsScholarshipsHist.txt 
     resource: 8a2cd8d3-003d-4b09-8b63-747365582370 
     code: bcdc_get_data(record = '651b60c2-6786-488b-aa96-c4897531a884', resource = '8a2cd8d3-003d-4b09-8b63-747365582370')

Please choose one option: 

1: AwardsScholarshipsHist.xlsx
2: AwardsScholarshipsHist.txt
```

A catalogue record can have one or multiple data files---or "resources". If there are multiple data resources the user will need to specify which resource they want. bcdata gives the user the option to interactively choose which resource they want, but for scripts it is usually better to be explicit using the `resource` argument to specify the desired dataset. In addition, catalogue records are more reliably referred to by their permanent ID so bcdata also suggests supplying that to the `record` argument instead of the English string. We are interested, in this case, in the `.xlsx` file so we choose option 1 or:

```{r}
bc_scholarships <- bcdc_get_data(record = '651b60c2-6786-488b-aa96-c4897531a884', resource = '4e872f59-0127-4c21-9f41-52d87af9cfab')
```

The `bcdc_get_data()` function can be used to download geospatial data, including that which is available from the WFS. As a simple demonstration we can download the locations of airports in British Columbia:

```{r airports, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
bc_airports <- bcdc_get_data('bc-airports', resource = '4d0377d9-e8a1-429b-824f-0ce8f363512c')

ggplot(bc_airports) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

### `bcdc_query_geodata()`

While `bcdc_get_data()` will retrieve geospatial data, sometimes the geospatial file is very large---and slow to download---and/or the user may only want _some_ of the data. `bcdc_query_geodata()` allows the user to query catalogue geospatial data available from the Web Feature Service using `select` and `filter` functions (just like in [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), @dplyr). The `bcdc::collect()` function returns the `bcdc_query_geodata()` query results as an [`sf` object](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) in the R session. The data is only downloaded, and loaded into R as an ‘sf’ object, once the query is complete and the user requests the final result. This is implemented using a custom dbplyr backend---while other `dbplyr` backends interface with various databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL), the `bcdata` dplyr backend interfaces with the BC Web Feature Service.

Let's get the Capital Regional District boundary from the [B.C. Regional Districts geospatial data](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/d1aff64e-dbfe-45a6-af97-582b7f6418b9)---the whole file takes 30-60 seconds to download and we only need the one polygon, so why not save some time:

```{r regional_districts, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
## Find the B.C. Regional Districts catalogue record
bcdc_search("regional districts administrative areas", res_format = "wms", n = 1)

## Get the metadata for the B.C. Regional Districts catalogue record
bc_regional_districts_metadata <- bcdc_get_record("d1aff64e-dbfe-45a6-af97-582b7f6418b9")

## Have a quick look at the geospatial columns to help with filter or select
bcdc_describe_feature(bc_regional_districts_metadata)

## Get the Capital Regional District polygon from the B.C. Regional
## Districts geospatial data
my_regional_district <- bcdc_query_geodata(bc_regional_districts_metadata) %>%
  filter(ADMIN_AREA_NAME == "Capital Regional District") %>%
  collect()

## Plot the Capital Regional District polygon with ggplot()
my_regional_district  %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Conclusion

Connecting the R programming language with the B.C. Data Catalogue creates an API that allows for the usage of cutting edge statistical and plotting capabilities with a vast collection of open and public data. The enables usages in a modern data science context and provides a pathway to generate insights from public data.
