\title{Load the B.C. Data Catalogue URL into an HTML browser}
\usage{
bcdc_browse(query = NULL, browser = getOption("browser"),
  encodeIfNeeded = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A string to search in the bcdata catalogue. Default (NULL) opens
a browser to \code{https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca}.}

\item{browser}{a non-empty character string giving the name of the
    program to be used as the HTML browser.  It should be in the PATH,
    or a full path specified.  Alternatively, an \R function to be
    called to invoke the browser.

    Under Windows \code{NULL} is also allowed (and is the default), and
    implies that the file association mechanism will be used.
  }

\item{encodeIfNeeded}{Should the URL be encoded by
    \code{\link{URLencode}} before passing to the browser?  This is not
    needed (and might be harmful) if the \code{browser} program/function
    itself does encoding, and can be harmful for \samp{file://} URLs on some
    systems and for \samp{http://} URLs passed to some CGI applications.
    Fortunately, most URLs do not need encoding.}
}
\value{
