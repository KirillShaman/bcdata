\title{Download and read a dataset from a B.C. Data Catalogue resource}
\usage{
bcdc_get_data(x, format = NULL, resource = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{either a \code{bcdc_record} object (from the result of \code{bcdc_get_record()})
or a character string denoting the id of a resource (or the url).

It is advised to use the permament id for a record rather than the
human-readable name to guard against future name changes of the record.
If you use the human-readble name a warning will be issued once per
session. You can silence these warnings altogether by setting an option:
\code{options("silence_named_get_data_warning" = TRUE)} - which you can set
in your .Rprofile file so the option persists across sessions.}

\item{format}{Defaults to NULL which will first check to see if the record is a WMS/WFS record.
If so an sf object is returned. Otherwise a format needs to be specified. \code{bcdc_get_record} can
be used to identify which formats are available.}

\item{resource}{option argument used when there are multiple data files of the same format
within the same record. See examples.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to other functions. For spatial (WMS/WFS) data these are passed to
\code{bcdc_query_geodata()}. Non spatial data is passed to a function to handle the import based
on the file extension.}
}
\value{
an object of a type relevant to the resource (usually a tibble or an sf object)
}
