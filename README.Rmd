# bcdata

An R package ðŸ“¦ for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data Catalogue]( https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

- `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
- `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
- `bcdc_search_facet()` - List catalogue facet search options
- `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
- `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
- `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data---geospatial data must be available as a [Web Map or Web Feature Service (WMS/WFS)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E)


### Reference
[bcdata package ðŸ“¦ home page and reference guide](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/index.html)

### Installation
You can install `bcdata` directly from this GitHub repository using the [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcdata")
library(bcdata)
```


### Vignettes

- [Get started with bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/bcdata.html)
- [Querying spatial data with bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/efficiently-query-spatial-data-in-the-bc-data-catalogue.html)
- Using bcdata with bcmaps (coming soon!)

<!--
### Usage

```{r, eval = TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
bcdc_search("airport")
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
bcdc_get_record("76b1b7a3-2112-4444-857a-afccf7b20da8")
```

### bcdc_get_data
To have a quick look at spatial data, you can simply print the object:
```{r}
airports <- bcdc_query_geodata("bc-airports", crs = 3857)
airports
```
If you need all the data, you need to retrieve the data using the `collect` function:
```{r}
airports %>% 
  collect()
```
This has the advantage of fine tuning your query without issuing a large request to the data catalogue. When you are finally ready to bring all the data you want into memory then you can use the `collect` function. This approach mimics that developed for `dbplyr`. You can read more about that [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbplyr/vignettes/dbplyr.html)
