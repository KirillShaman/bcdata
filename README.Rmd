# bcdata

An R package ðŸ“¦ for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data Catalogue]( https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

### Installation
You can install `bcdata` directly from this GitHub repository. To do so, you will need the [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

Next, install and load the `bcdata` package using `remotes::install_github()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcdata")
library(bcdata)
```



### Functions

- `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
- `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
- `bcdc_search_facet()` - List catalogue facet search options
- `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
- `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
- `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get catalogue geospatial data (data must be available as a [WMS/WFS service](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E))

### Usage

```{r, eval = TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
bcdc_search("airport")
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
bcdc_get_record("76b1b7a3-2112-4444-857a-afccf7b20da8")
```

### bcdc_get_data
To have a quick look at spatial data, you can simply print the object:
```{r}
airports <- bcdc_get_geodata("bc-airports", crs = 3857)
airports
```
If you need all the data, you need to retrieve the data using the `collect` function:
```{r}
airports %>% 
  collect()
```
This has the advantage of fine tuning your query without issuing a large request to the data catalogue. When you are finally ready to bring all the data you want into memory then you can use the `collect` function. This approach mimics that developed for `dbplyr`. You can read more about that [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbplyr/vignettes/dbplyr.html)
