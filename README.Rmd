An R package ðŸ“¦ for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data Catalogue]( https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

- `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
- `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
- `bcdc_search_facet()` - List catalogue facet search options
- `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
- `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
- `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data available as a [Web Map or Web Feature Service (WMS/WFS)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E)

The `bcdata` package supports downloading _most_ file types, however the package does _not_ retrieve .zip or compressed resource files at this time.
